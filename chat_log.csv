It's important to take your feelings seriously. Let's start by acknowledging that you're experiencing a lot of stress and emotional pain. It's not uncommon to feel overwhelmed, especially when work demands are high. But it's crucial to understand that having thoughts of harming yourself is a sign that you need immediate support and care.

Firstly, let's ensure your safety. If you're in immediate danger, please contact local emergency services or a crisis hotline. In the US, for example, you can call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255). If you're outside the US, look up your local crisis hotline.

Now, let's address your feelings of stress. It's important to remember that stress is not always something to be avoided. In manageable doses, it can even be beneficial, helping us to focus and perform better. However, it's clear that you're experiencing more stress than is helpful, and it's becoming harmful.

Let's try to slow down together. It's okay to take a moment to pause and listen to what your body and mind need. It might be helpful to speak to your employer about how you're feeling. They may be able to provide support or adjust your workload. Also, consider reaching out to a mental health professional. They can provide strategies and tools tailored to your situation.

Remember, it's not a failure to ask for help. It's a sign of strength and courage. You deserve to be heard and supported. It's also important to remind yourself that you are more than your work. Your value and worth are not defined by your productivity.

For now, let's take things one step at a time. Let's focus on your immediate safety and emotional well-being. Please reach out to a crisis hotline or a trusted person in your life. You are not alone, and your feelings are valid. We can work through this together.

In the long term, consider incorporating rest and self-care into your routine. This could be through meditation, spending time in nature, or engaging in hobbies you enjoy. It's all about finding that balance between productivity and rest.",False
